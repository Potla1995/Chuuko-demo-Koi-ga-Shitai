			<h2 class="sub-header">Welcome!</h2>
			<p> This is a website made with the intention of hosting translations for the light novel called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8F%A4%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E6%81%8B%E3%81%8C%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%81%84!">"中古でも恋がしたい!"</a>, written by Tao Noritake-sensei and featuring illustrations by ReDrop-sensei. The manga adaptation for this LN is titled "リアルな彼女なんて要らない". The title roughly translates to "Even a used girl wants to experience love!" (LN) / "I don't need a 3D girlfriend" (Manga). I will be translating the novel as I keep reading it myself in my free time, and hence cannot guarantee anything about the quality, accuracy, or frequency of updates. </p>
			<p> This LN has been a pretty fun read so far, mostly because I feel a brotherly bond with the protagonist of the story, who is also an eroge otaku. I-it's not like I play a lot of VN's or anything, okay? </p>
			<h2 class="sub-header">Synopsis (from NovelUpdates)</h2>
			<p> Aramiya Seiichi is an ordinary high school... eroge otaku who’s given up all hope on girls in the 3D world due to a certain incident. One day, after he's bought a bunch of new materials as a result of experiencing the frustration of a perfect eroge character turning out to be "used goods," he encounters a delinquent-looking girl about to get raped by a bunch of guys. By mere chance, he rescues her. Days later, when school starts again, it turns out to have been his classmate, Ayame, a feared delinquent girl who's got all kind of rumors about her – especially that she’s "used goods." And it appears that she's set on becoming his ideal girl to make him fall for her. </p>
			<h2 class="sub-header">About this project</h2>
			<p> I had first started reading this LN back in 2018, using the translations from <a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/58637-chuuko-demo-koi-ga-shitai/chapter/58738/">Kondee</a>, and after completely finishing reading till volume 2, had tried to read through the raws. However, my Japanese at that time was not good enough to tackle this herculean task, so I gave up midway. Kondee also seem to have stopped updating this LN since December 2017, as mentioned in the <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/chuuko-demo-koi-ga-shitai/">NovelUpdates</a> Page. This is an attempt to continue translating the LN which already has 12 volumes released at this time, while at the same time, hoping to improve my Japanese. I'll start Volume 3 from scratch as warmup. </p>
			<p> One sad thing though, is that I'm a PhD Student, and don't have a lot of time to do this. It is also very uncertain whether I can keep myself motivated for long enough. But while the steam lasts, I hope to not disappoint people. I aim to be able to translate at least a couple of pages per day, which would mean around four to five months per volume. </p>
			<h2 class="sub-header">Disclaimers</h2>
			<p> English and Japanese are my third and fourth languages respectively, so please cut me some slack regarding grammatical issues or downright mistranslations. Please don't hesitate to point them out though, it'll help me improve in both English and Japanese! Again, as of now I have no editor to fix my English. If you're interested in editing for this project, just send me a DM on Twitter! ^^ </p>
