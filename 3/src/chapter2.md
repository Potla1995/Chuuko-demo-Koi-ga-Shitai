# Chapter 2: Then, should we go buy swimsuits?
_Note:_ _From this chapter on I'll be shifting to present tense for narration._

Ever since the club room became unusable, we tried to search for the culprit behind the rumors, but as expected, it wasn't as easy.

The rumors kept spreading around day by day, all the while getting more and more exaggerated.

"They say Aramiya-kun is actually super rich, and is doing as he pleases with girls..."

According to Hatsushiba's report to me in the classroom, even such a topic had been coming up.

"If it was possible to do whatever you like to the opposite sex using the money from something like part time jobs, companies would cease to exist.
In the first place my dad is a humble salaryman who complains to me saying 'there's not enough money to drink this month!'..."

Sometimes he even tries to extort money from me.
Usually it ends with mom yelling at him, though.

"Well, rumors progress without careful investigation about the details..."

"It's easy nowadays for rumors to spread via the internet after all.
Are they exchanging such messages over smartphones or something?"

"You mean like those underground sites?"

"Also including that.
I think it's more mainstream nowadays to use group messages though.
There's even this gigantic group chat that includes ordinary people like students from other schools."

The influence of celebrities is not something to be sneezed at, after all.
Anyone with an influential voice can make a single statement, and it will spread like wildfire, with a high permeation ratio as well.
Even more so if it was something that cannot be reversed.

I don't have accounts on almost all SNS sites, so am not really sure about the details.
I have a twitter account on which I follow eroge makers... is as far as it goes.
I myself have tweeted absolutely nothing.

"In that case, we need to look into the smartphones of other people."

"Going that far though..."

Searching around for personal stuff arbitrarily is a no-go, no matter what reasons one might have.

Even if decisive evidence comes out of it, the police will get involved after that.

That being said, very soon we would be unable to search for the culprit or even exterminate the rumors about Ayame.

The final exams coming close, it was around time to start preparing for them.

"This formula is very basic.
Beat it into your head."

Like a thunder god as always, Tadokoro was exerting his shrewdness during the math lecture today as well.

After erasing the blackboard packed with formulas and solutions, he moved his hand and started writing with force again in the space that got empty.
His expression of the eyes that glared at the classroom looked like that of a ferocious hawk.
It was really scary.
