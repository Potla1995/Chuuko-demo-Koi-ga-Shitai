# Chapter 2: Then, should we go buy swimsuits?
_Note:_ _From this chapter on I'll be shifting to present tense for narration._

Ever since the club room became unusable, we tried to search for the culprit behind the rumors, but as expected, it wasn't as easy.

The rumors kept spreading around day by day, all the while getting more and more exaggerated.

"They say Aramiya-kun is actually super rich, and is doing as he pleases with girls..."

According to Hatsushiba's report to me in the classroom, even such a topic had been coming up.

"If it was possible to do whatever you like to the opposite sex using the money from something like part time jobs, companies would cease to exist.
In the first place my dad is a humble salaryman who complains to me saying 'there's not enough money to drink this month!'..."

Sometimes he even tries to extort money from me.
Usually it ends with mom yelling at him, though.

"Well, rumors progress without careful investigation about the details..."

"It's easy nowadays for rumors to spread via the internet after all.
Are they exchanging such messages over smartphones or something?"

"You mean like those underground sites?"

"Also including that.
I think it's more mainstream nowadays to use group messages though.
There's even this gigantic group chat that includes ordinary people like students from other schools."

The influence of celebrities is not something to be sneezed at, after all.
Anyone with an influential voice can make a single statement, and it will spread like wildfire, with a high permeation ratio as well.
Even more so if it was something that cannot be reversed.

I don't have accounts on almost all SNS sites, so am not really sure about the details.
I have a twitter account on which I follow eroge makers... is as far as it goes.
I myself have tweeted absolutely nothing.

"In that case, we need to look into the smartphones of other people."

"Going that far though..."

Searching around for personal stuff arbitrarily is a no-go, no matter what reasons one might have.

Even if decisive evidence comes out of it, the police will get involved after that.

That being said, very soon we would be unable to search for the culprit or even exterminate the rumors about Ayame.

The final exams coming close, it was around time to start preparing for them.

"This formula is very basic.
Beat it into your head."

Like a thunder god as always, Tadokoro was exerting his shrewdness during the math lecture today as well.

After erasing the blackboard packed with formulas and solutions, he moved his hand and started writing with force again in the space that got empty.
His expression of the eyes that glared at the classroom looked like that of a ferocious hawk.
It was really scary.

In order to eliminate pointlessly studying the same part again, Ayame was listening to the lecture intently.

"For this problem... Ayame. Come front and solve it."

"Y-yes!"

While jolting her twintails, Ayame somewhat nervously went up to the front.

Then, with mannerisms that seemed to lack confidence, she started writing on the chalkboard with a strange handwriting.

"Hmm, correct.
You escaped death."

_TL Note: Wow this is actually scary xD_

Ayame let out a sigh of relief.

"If you had gotten this one wrong, you would have to take supplementary lessons over summer break without having to wait for the finals."

Tadokoro said so while smirking, as if having fun.

After receiving the "not guilty" verdict, Ayame was relieved from the bottom of her heart.

She returned to her desk, making a tired face.

"You must be able to do problems of this level.
In order to gauge the understanding of this class, we'll have another short test before the finals.
Make sure to review the material properly before then."

"Eee~...", a negative tone erupted from the class.

However, everyone went silent the moment Tadokoro sharply glared at the classroom with a glint in his eyes.

As expected of the Thunder god.
Those eyes hold impressive power.

"Mu..."

The chime started ringing from the speakers.

That marked the end of class.
My classmates relaxed after unfastening their nerves.

"Good timing.
Let's end class here today.
Everyone, be careful not to neglect your preparations."

After deftly collecting everything left on the teacher's desk, Tadokoro swiftly left the classroom -- but he looked back before leaving.

... Is he looking in my direction?

"... Right, I had forgotten.
Aramiya, I have something to ask you.
Come with me."

"Eh..."

Being suddenly called on like that, I got confused about what was happening for a bit.

Everyone's eyes looked at me at once.
They were looks of sympathy.
Or rather, they silently conveyed 'just what did you do'?
I haven't done anything!

"I asked you to come with me.
Could you not hear me?"

Tadokoro's eyes shrunk like a string within moments.
Just five seconds until he starts yelling.
This is bad.
I must hurry.

"I have a question."

"Ha, haa. What is it?"

We faced each other after going out to the hallway.
He had a different pressure compared to Ayame.

Even though there were a lot of people in the hallway, it being right after the end of a period.
Although no one seemed to be blatantly eavesdropping.

Then, Tadokoro spoke up in a small voice inaudible to the surroundings."

"Aramiya.
Is it true that you are violating girls and doing indecent things in the clubroom?"

"Eh?"

"I'm asking if it's true."

No way.

Certainly even Tadokoro did not believe in the rumors and now wants me to show him?...
Haha, definitely not.
That can't be called character breaking anymore.

"Why, do you..."

"It was a topic of discussion during the staff meeting."

... Don't the teachers have too much free time?

But still, this is a serious issue.
Looking at it from the other side, that the teachers are making a big deal out of it was proof that the rumor had permeated quite thoroughly.

"Isn't it obvious that it's a fake rumor?
It'd help if the teachers also didn't start getting fooled by it.
I'm super troubled here."

"Guessed so.
However, there is meaning behind me getting the word of rejection from your mouth."

"Hmm?
But staff meeting... isn't our homeroom teacher supposed to ask me instead?"

I don't remember Oohara-sensei asking me anything like that?

"That's because Ms. Oohara outright rejected it.
'Aramiya-kun isn't a child who would do something like that.', is what she said.
Plus, she isn't fit for interrogating students.
She still has places she lacks experience in."

Oh, as expected of sensei!
Her trust really hit it home.

"And, Ms. Kotani also rejected it."

Kiriko-neesan as well, eh.
That was very nice of her.
As expected of my cousin.

"'He probably doesn't have that kind of ability'"

I take back my last thoughts.
... No, it's the truth, but is irritating.

"Erm... did Tadokoro-sensei believe in it?"

"I don't know, is my true opinion.
... What, is it surprising?"

"Frankly speaking, yes.
Sensei seems to be the type to conclude to zero or one immediately."

Tadokoro gave an uncharacteristic small sigh.

"Even if I've seen students for so long, I cannot determine their true intentions or true character.
Sometimes students with good conduct and no black marks in their record take part in swindles after school, and sometimes students who are good for nothing start non-profit organizations for betterment of society...
the hearts of people can change from one end to another through just one impetus.
In other words, seeing through people by just their appearance or attitude is impossible."

Sounded like he had real experience mixed in the last statement.

He can probably say that after seeing off any huge number of students.

"In that sense, Ayame is unusual.
Aramiya, you too."

"Eh? Me?"

"Yes.
I never thought you would be someone to run full speed through the hallway."

"... If you don't mind me asking, I'd like to know your evaluation (of me)."

"You'd give full effort on things that you're interested in.
However, you'd not put more than the minimum effort in things that don't interest you, and try to avoid standing out.
Am I right?"

... Woah, he's right.
He observes very closely.

"That's exactly why it was unexpected for me that you'd try stopping Ayame, or even run for that.
The image of you dispassionately spending your school days was strong in my mind, after all."

"I see.
Even I used to think the same..."

"There are things people themselves don't understand.
It is presumptious to think that others could understand your nature, even if they're adults.
Of course, there are a lot of students who are exactly how I imagine them to be, but there are exceptions everywhere."

Tadokoro always taught his classes full of confidence, so I thought he was the type of teacher who would think that they are omnipotent.

But in reality, he was different.

It felt more like he was trying his hardest to get close to his ideal, all the while worrying about various things.
