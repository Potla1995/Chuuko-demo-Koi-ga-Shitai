# Chapter 3: For me, you're good.

+ _Progress: pages 148-160 done out of 148-198 (~22% done)._
+ _I had to slow down due to RL commitments (internship + teaching + research + osu tournaments welp). However, all is not lost, as it seems this chapter will end up with considerably less typos and mistranslations than the previous ones thanks to the lower speed._
+ _There are many cute Ayame-chan and Kiyomi-chan moments coming up in the chapter; now Aramiya knows why his sister berates him so much. Well, not that he plans on fixing any of it._ :waturr:
+ _ETA: before August 2020 if things go as planned._

## Part 1/5

The morning sun is bright.

The sunlight mercilessly shining into the room from the window leads to uncomfortable sweating.

However, my mood is great!

After all, today is a holiday.

I can finally consume the eroge that I bought after a long while.
Until now the midterm exams, Ayame's rumours and Ibu's matter etc had been keeping me busy, leading to no time to play eroge after school!

Along with drinks and snacks, my preparation is also flawless.
The headphones are also brand-new.
Haven't changed the sound card though!

The installation was also completed late last night.

While there also was the option of staying up all night playing, it would be too much to do so during summer vacations.
Rather, playing at full health potential is how you should honor playing VNs.

After a night's sound sleep in preparation for today, there is no one in this world that can stop me!

So, let's start!
"Magician's Joker", here we--.

_TL Note:_ Probably referring to [Sorcery Jokers](https://vndb.org/v16337).

"Yo, onii-chan♪"

!?

... What was that voice just now?

It wasn't the <span title = "omake voice ">voice effect</span> that pops up before the title screen.

It sounded like it came from someone at home, almost as if it was Kiyomi's voice...

"Ki-Kiyomi?"

"Yes, that's right♪
Can I come in?
I'm coming in~"

Not waiting for my reply, she entered the room.

Her attire was that for going out, not the usual roomwear.
It was clearly different from usual.

A white short-sleeved frilly blouse and a black skirt with suspenders.
The colour scheme resembled a maid's clothes, just a little.
She had these clothes, eh.

While her smile appeals a sweet purity, her behaviour is quite suspicious.
Remember how fraudsters try to hide their true colours?
This looks very similar to that.

"What are you scheming?"

"Oh come on--.
Onii-chan and your assumptions.
Kiyomi is a bit shocked."

Did she hit her head or something?
Is there a hole in her brain?

"As if you would call me onii-chan without any ulterior motive!
Is it money?
Is it my life?"

"Nothing like that--.
I just wanted to go out for a bit with onii-chan~."

"... Go out?"

"Yep! Shopping at the station!"

"So you want me to carry your luggage?
What heavy stuff do you want to buy?
A fridge for your own room?
Then get it delivered or something..."

"Nothing of that sort--.
Let's just go!"

"Don't wanna!
Why do I have to go out with you on my long awaited holiday?"

Ask again after reducing a dimension. (JP: "Come back after becoming 2D" xD)

"Don't say such mean things--. Please♪"

Being pulled at, I'm forcefully made to stand up from the chair.

She embraces my arm, acting spoiled.
Her mood is also so great that it's uncomparable with the usual.
Did she get possessed by her past life's spirit?

"Look, let's go~"

"Am I not saying that I don't wanna!
Did you just forget how you talked with me till yesterday?
Calling me a virgin over and over again with scorn, we now don't even have the relationship to hang out together, right?!"

"... Onii-chan."

"Pretend tears won't work.
It's easy to understand when your tears are real and when they aren't."

"You won't come with me?"

"Absolutely not."

My stance is that of firm refusal.
Using sweet words is not going to be effective!

Right at that moment, something creaked up making a whooshing sound.

Kiyomi's lowkick had already connected.

Followed by a sharp pain.

At the impact that shook my very core, I kneel down holding my leg.

"GUOOOOO...!"

_TL Note:_ RIP. My condolences.

"When I asked nicely once, just accept it!
Come with me right now!
You never had the right to reject my request from the beginning!"

"S-such a c-coercion...!"

Kiyomi's face turned beet red in pure anger.

If you send her to hell together with a golden staff, she will surely make a living out there.

"So, what'll be it?
You coming?
Or not?
I'll keep kicking until you answer yes though."

In front of that tone with no trace of tolerance, my life felt like in danger.

&nbsp;

After changing into outdoor clothes, I go out with Kiyomi.

... It's not like I lost. It's not like I gave in!

In order to save one's body from ruination, it is sometimes inevitable to accept the opponent's demands.
Just like how Finland ultimately succumbed to the Soviet Union in order to defend its independence.

If it's obvious that you'll face a terrible outcome, then sometimes accepting the unjust demands at the beginning is wise.
Maybe that option can help you protect things that are important.

_TL Note:_ Yeah, very convincing argument. Just admit it already, your sister is too stonks.

"Can you not show a more pleasant face?"

"You even want to demand that..."

This type of abuse will not be tolerated by the <span title = "jp. 国際社会, literally, 'international community'.">United Nations</span>.

While heading towards the station with pouting faces,

"Oh? Kiyomi--!"

Three girls come up to us while waving.
Tall, Chubby, Loli - were the outer characteristics of the three, and their clothes were also red, blue and pink in colour.
What a non-uniform trio.

Looking beside me, Kiyomi seems to be having a fit of cold sweat that cries "what bad timing".
Then, her glare towards me told "don't say anything unnecessary".
Her eyes are easy to understand.

"Sup! What are the three of you upto, at a place like this?"

"Just some shopping.
And, this person is..."

All three of them face in my direction.
Since I don't know their names, let's name the tall person "Dog", the chubby girl "Mag", and the loli "Rag".

"It's a date, right?"

Mag was smiling complacently while teasingly throwing that question at Kiyomi.

"Nope. This is caregiving."

However, Kiyomi immediately replies back with a disgruntled face.
It's not right to call this caregiving.
I want to hit her.

... Not knowing what to say, I stay silent.
Getting another lowkick driven into would make my legs useless.
I'll definitely be in bed for a whole day.

And, it's very troublesome if they call this a date.

"He's not your lover?"

Rag inclines her head to the side while sending an innocent gaze.
Apparently it was already determined that I'm her lover in their heads.

"As if! I'd definitely tell you if I get a lover anyway."

Kiyomi who rejects with a troubled face.
She starts emitting an aura that she wants to quickly leave the area.

However, it seems like she isn't able to shake off her friends.
As if stuck in a hard place, her eyes also start rolling around uncomfortably.

"By any chance, are you the rumoured onii-san?"

When Dog said so calmly, Kiyomi's face instantly cramps.
It's a very satisfying one-hit attack.

Kiyomi became flustered, unsure about how to answer.

... It's not like we need to lie.
She was already defeated when she made this kind of an expression.

"Yeah, that's right.
Are you guys Kiyomi's classmates?"

"Yes.
You really are her onii-san, right?"

"Doesn't she always deny my existence in class?"

"Ahaha, did you know that already.
But she would always overreact, so we were talking amongst ourselves how the brother must exist."

Even if no one asks you, if you out of the blue say something like "I don't have an elder brother, okay?", then no wonder the cat would be out of the bag. I can even imagine that scene right now.

After Dog finishes speaking, Mag butted in from the side.

"Moreover, the person that tamed that Ayame-senpai <span title="jp. 裏番">famous in underground</span> also went by the name of 'Aramiya', so--"

"... Underground? Ayame?"

"Is that wrong?"

Well, it can't be helped if they misunderstood her from her previous appearance.

But it's different now.

No, she was probably never even involved with underground agencies.
Plus who is their representative?
I don't recall seeing anyone like that in school.

_TL Note:_ I'm a bit confused about this part. Mag said before that Ayame was a part of the underground world (裏番), and Aramiya wants to know what the overground (表番) person looked like. So I interpreted 表番 as a front face of these underground agencies.

"She's just a normal girl.
Please try not to be fooled by rumors that much, guys..."

The three said a "ye~s" together.

Wow, aren't these girls nice and docile!

"But, Aramiya-senpai is also being scared of nowadays.
We hear that you're a dangerous person.
Looking at you like this though, it really seems unfounded..."

Rag says cheerfully with a pure smile.

"... That's also false, OK?"

"Men are wolves, they say."

"Wolves = men is not true, OK?"

"Sometimes it's the wolves that are more popular though?"

"It's not like I wanna be popular anyway."

I'm already popular in 2D, and don't have any interest in 3D anyway.

Via eroge I have lived several first press limited lifetimes, and that's enough for me.

"But, has that rumour even permeated among the first years?"

"It came out very recently.
And everytime it did, Kiyomi-chan would knit her brows..."

"Waaawaaa! Waaawaaa!" (TN: flustered screaming)

The frozen Kiyomi suddenly rebooted.

"Let's go already!
Sorry guys, see you next week!"

"Bye bye, Kiyomi-chan" "Kiyomi, don't forget about next week's promise--" "Kiyomin, bye!"

Receiving their greetings on our backs, we start wallking towards our goal.

For a while, Kiyomi kept up her red faced anger. Are you a [red demon](https://nohmask21.com/onimen/aka-ao/aka-oni2b.jpg)?

"Good grief...! Must remind them later to keep this a secret."

"Isn't that very bothersome?
Is it not fine if they know?
We don't really meet that frequently in school anyway."

"Then just be more resolute!
Like how you were during elementary school... get good scores in tests, and first place in the sports tournament too..."

"Oh, so you want a competent elder brother?"

"Obviously. I am--"

"Just kidding.
At this point, what will come out of trying hard?
Plus, elementary school and high school are very different in the nature of studies and athletics.
During elementary school, just putting in a little effort can get you first place, but starting high school it becomes impossible with just a little effort.
One needs to pile up proportional effort on top of proportional effort, and your free time would also decrease just by that much."

In other words, the time for playing eroge would decrease.

"Stop with your pretentious speech!
It's not like I have any expectation from you, do whatever you like!
Either way, let's go quickly!"

"Yeah, yeah."

Dear me! Such a high-maintenance sister.

&nbsp;

We reach the fountain plaza in front of the station.
Continuously pumping up however much water, the fountain shows the current time in a consistent rhythm.
First time when I saw this it was super exciting a technology, but after seeing the same scene for around ten years, the same scene doesn't really move me that much.
Rather, it feels rather inconvenient that the fountain doesn't show the current time immediately.
Makes me think how humans are so selfish about their conveniences.

_TL Note:_ If you don't know, Kanazawa station has a [spectacular fountain clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzGuf7enE7o). Gotta check it out next time I visit Japan!

Due to the constant flux of people, this place is pretty restless.
Everyone who just stare at the view absent-mindedly kind of seem like otakus who stare at the circles of their admiration during comiket.

"So, where are we going?"

"Mm, just wait a bit."

The big culprit who brought me to this place was currently staring daggers at her smartphone.
Seems like she's looking something up; not sure what.

When I tried sneaking a peek at the display, I was rebuked with a "pervert!", so I just obediently pulled back.
As mentioned countless times already, <span title="jp. 君子は危うきに近寄らないんだよ">the wise don't approach trouble on their own</span>.
That's exactly how one survives life just riding the flow of current.

"Yosh."

Seems like her search ended, leading to an enthusiastic utterance.

"You, wait here for a bit."

"Haa?"

What does she mean by waiting?

I don't understand the meaning of taking me this far and then making me wait/

"I'll be right back.
You're dead if you return home."

Threatening me however much she likes, Kiyomi went off somewhere.

It's not like I'll be killed if I go back home...
But the continuous lowkicks would probably break my bones.

Well, this kind of stuff can be fine sometimes... or not.
If you're making me wait here, return my eroge playtime.

『Well, it's a good opportunity, so try to get along a bit better.
If you only squabble all the time, you'll eternally never make up.
Just grow up.』

Were the words of a wise Tozaki a while ago that I suddenly remembered.

... Well, even I don't think of our current relationship as healthy.

It'll be troublesome if she starts saying stuff like "Onii-chan, love you♪" or "Onii-sama, please let me be by your side forever" like 2D imoutos, but her calling me "virgin" and me calling her "bitch" is not good for the public eyes.
Not like we call each other those names in public,

At least I won't hesitate for us to return to a "Yo" or "Hey you" level.

It's not like I want her to start conversation while in school, or cross each other.

If we settle down to a generally distant sister and elder brother, I guess my life would be much more calmer.
I wouldn't have to be so much wary as well.

"... Should I try start talking with her a little?"

Why does she despise my guts this much?

Earlier she said something like she wants me to take first place in academics and athletics in school, but is that somehow related?

I can't even remember exactly when we started squabbling like this, and don't remember the stimulus that started all this.
And we never really talked face-to-face about this topic.

I do remember she stopped calling me "Onii-chan" after elementary school...

"Well, it's also the big brother's responsibility to break the barrier."

As I was heaving a deep sigh, my smartphone vibrated.
A message had arrived apparently.

Looking at the display, three simple words had popped up.

"I'm returning. Bye~"

......

...Huh?

What the hell is up?
Telling me not to go back and then returning by yourself, just what are you thinking?

I have no idea why she dragged me all the way out here too. Jus what is this?

Harrassment!? Real sisters are really the darkest of the evil creatures!

Wasn't all this just a waste of time then?
Damn, seriously, give back my past.
Give me back my one hour of eroge playtime!

After all, it is impossible for me to compromise for her!

&nbsp;

"Y-yo, Aramiya."

&nbsp;

I turn around at the voice from behind.

Frankly speaking, I knew it was Ayame the moment she called over.

But--.

"I-isn't it a coincidence..."

The Ayame that had appeared was nothing like the usual.
To the point that I almost looked around, searching the surroundings for her figure.

Like a white lily fully bloomed, she was clad in a tidy white one-piece.

Complete with a straw hat that some young woman might wear on a trip to a summer resort.

And a fancy handbag hanging from her shoulder.

The twintails, face, and body composition that stands out is clearly that of Ayame, however...

One could not think her to be the same Ayame I was habituated with.

"A princess travelling incognito" would be an apt description of her current figure.

Totally a get-up that would one-shot virgins.
Frankly, it feels like she's aiming at my head.

"..."

"Aramiya...?"

"A-Ayame,... right?"
