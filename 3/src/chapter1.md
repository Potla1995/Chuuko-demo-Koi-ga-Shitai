# Chapter 1: Please listen to what I have to say!

It was early summer.
It wasn't that hot since it was the morning, but it'll slowly get worse from here.

It was not yet time to start the AC, so without wind coming in through the windows, the classroom would become too hot to concentrate properly.

"Electric fans are the best for this temperature, right?
Wish they installed them."

Ayame, who walked together with me to school, said so after passing through the school gates.

"The strong winds of a circulator is also good.
Well, even electric fans would turn over the pages of the textbooks or notebooks, hindering concentration."

Plus, it's okay while sitting inside the classroom, but during break time the girls will be troubled with the fans playing mischief on their skirts.

Boys being boys, would also do the "We are aliens" gig in front of the fans.
No doubt there.

_TL Note:_ "Wareware wa Uchuujin da" or "We are aliens" gig is when you keep an electric fan running and let it distort your voice. You must have done it when you were small. xD I remember this scene from Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko. Basically, something elementary school children would love to do.

"Wish the season to turn on the AC comes fast."

"Wait, where did you even go while skipping classes during our first year?
Wasn't it hot everywhere?"

"I'd mostly be in the infirmary.
It was really cool and comfortable to sleep."

Oh, there was that option too.
Not that it's useful for me.

"How did the health teacher not bat an eye at you skipping classes..."

... Long story short, the health teacher also was also scared of her, so she had to hold out.

"I-it's not like I was a hindrance.
I left the bed whenever someone who was actually injured needed it."

"Is that so."

We reached the entrance while talking about Ayame during our first year.
After changing to indoor slippers in front of the shoe lockers, we headed towards the classroom.

"Whew..."

"You always get nervous right before entering the classroom these days."

"No, I mean..."

"It's fine, just get in already!"

After being forcefully pressed on by me, Ayame opened the door and entered the classroom, still with a cramped face.

"M-Morning"

She greeted everyone reservedly.

Then,

"M-Morning, Ayame-san." "Morning, Ayame-san." "Mornin' mornin'!" "Good morning."

Nishihara, Class Rep and the other girls, and

"H-hey, morning." "'Sup." "Again with Aramiya, I see. It's become all natural now, eh."

Matoba, Mikamoto and other boys among the classmates replied back.

Since Hatsushiba's announcement (The boys secretly called this event "Hatsushiba-on-stage"), their attitude towards Ayame had softened to the point of them being able to exchange greetings.

Ayame herself still wasn't used to this, and many classmates were throwing puzzled looks, but it was decent progress.

"Haha, it really feels nice when people return your greeting.
Thanks a lot, Aramiya."

Ayame told me in a voice audible to only me.

"It's fully thanks to Hatsushiba though.
I didn't really do anything."

"No, you created the chance for Yuuka to act.
So I'm thankful to everyone."

She then headed towards her desk with light footsteps.

Well, it's all good if Ayame is happy.

&nbsp;

The fourth period ended, and the sun was about to ascend to the highest point.

It was lunch break, and more than half of the classmates had run off to the canteen or school store.
The rest were relishing their lunch by sitting across their familiar friends and opening up lunch boxes.

Glancing out of the window of the classroom, one could see the strong sunlight flooding the cloudless sky.
If used as an eroge background, the blue sky would have seemed like the artist had cut corners.

Although it was already monsoon, there was little rainfall this year.

"Ah-☆ Tasty~"

A nonchalant voice entered our ears.

The source was Suwama Ibu, who was holding a vibrant lunch box with a happy expression.

The twintails made of blonde curly hair had an amazing volume.
The hair clips tying them were shaped like candies, inducing a fairytale-like atmosphere.
There were star-shaped marks on her nails, and the accessories on her uniform and fingers were all over-the-top.
It was a figure of a very modern gal.
If it wasn't for our school, the public morals committee would definitely have been exasperated at her get-up.

"... Isn't this a heavy atmosphere?"

However, my close friend, Tozaki Keita was making an awkward face beside me, looking at Ibu who was acting merry for no reason.
Although it was a rarity to see him bring his own lunch box, the chopsticks holding his side dishes were mildly shaking.

"Is that so?"

Beside him, Hatsushiba Yuuka had a sour look on her face.
Her displeasure was apparent.
Tozaki who was sitting beside was making a painful face, as if unable to bear her curt tone.

"Suwama, you seem very happy while eating."

Ayame, lined up next to Hatsushiba, was likewise eating her lunch.

Sticking together two desks, we were enjoying our lunch boxes, sitting in a circle.

... However, Hatsushiba alone had a facial expression baring hostility.

I remembered how Tozaki had shuddered when Hatsushiba proposed having lunch together.

From the beginning, Hatsushiba was thinking about Ayame first and foremost.
And, Ibu could only be seen as an enemy who had tried to harm us before.

"Hatsushiba-cchi, the food will taste bad if you make such a scary face?"

"Please don't worry about it. This is how my face is."

Hatsushiba was making a face unfit for a voice actress at Ibu, who was oblivious to the disgust directed at her.
Was it an act?
Or was it her characteristic?
Scary...

"Ehh, really? Even though Hatsushiba-cchi is so cute..."

"... I'm not cute."

"Muuu. Let's be good friends! It's more fun that way, right?"

"......"

Hatsushiba looked like she'd get the popped-out-veins effect if it were an eroge.

Tozaki and Ayame, probably sensing that atmosphere, kept their mouths shut.

I was also keeping quiet.
Mob characters don't speak up while heroines are prattling among themselves.
By just speaking up to provide information that can become hints, they hit their assigned dialogue quota.
I also want to be like that.

"Come on, Seiichi~, you also tell her something!"

... Is how it should have been, but why did this girl have to stab at me...

"Don't know. Do something by yourself."

"You meanie!"

It's not my responsibility anyway, you reap what you sow.

_TL Note:_ Learned what the above proverb is in Japanese: it's 「身から出た錆だ」, which literally means "it's the rust from your body".

That being said, this dicey atmosphere while eating did not do Ayame (her reputation) any good.

While the misunderstandings of our classmates had been resolved, her image in the entire school had not changed that much.

Although, good rumors were just starting to float around, and joint classes like Physical Education had helped improve Ayame's impression among the neighboring class.

Eating lunch together was to prevent the classmates from relapsing to the misunderstandings, it also had the effect of warding off the worsening of her impression on students from other classes.

Therefore, it was quite likely that the countenance of eating as if it was the last supper might create some improper rumors about Ayame again.
Plus, the food also became unappetizing due to the atmosphere, which caused our feelings to go down.

"... Hey, Hatsushiba."

"... What? Aramiya-kun?"

It was a bit scary. Her sullen aura was piercing through my skin.

I started regretting talking to her. However, giving up midway wasn't an option.

"Can you just be a little accommodating?"

I timidly said as if fumbling around.

"... I'll be careful if Aramiya-kun says so."

"It's a request from me as well, Yuuka"

"I can't turn down Cotton's request... but..."

It seemed like she still wasn't fully convinced.
She showed a troubled attitude while furrowing her eyebrows.

Still, her expression more or less softened.

"Mhm, Hatsushiba-cchi is a cutie~☆"

"Nope, not really."

Well, Ibu kinda ruined it though.

After all, we finished our lunch boxes midst the uncomfortable atmosphere.

"Aramiya-kun, can we talk?"

Hatsushiba secretly whispered into my ears as soon as we returned the desks to their original positions after finishing lunch.

"Y-yeah, sure."

There was still time before the lunch break ended.

The place where Hatsushiba led me to was the landing of the stairwell in the edge of the school building.

"Hey, Yuuka still hasn't consented to having that girl in our club."

"It's apparent on your face."

Hatsushiba pouted a little at that remark.

It was a little amusing, like a kid.

"Why did you let her in?"

"Hatsushiba must also have noticed already... the weirdness of the rumors floating around last time."

rumors like Ayame loving to take part in orgies, or eating up girls regardless of gender.

It was unusual how it had spread through all of school in the blink of an eye.
It was not normal how fast it spread out, and how easily people believed in it.

"I understand that, but... wait, didn't she say she wasn't behind spreading it around?
Is it really necessary to let her in..."

"It is highly probable that she spread that rumour, while not realizing it herself."

"So you want to say she just acted as an <span title="媒介者">intermediary</span>?"

"That's right. Or maybe a <span title="中間宿主">middleman</span>.
That is, she might have caught the virus and just spread it around.
In that case, the problem is the source of that virus."

"Perhaps, there's someone close to her who is intentionally spreading rumors about Cotton?"

"It looks like that to me.
Since they're hiding this skillfully, it'll be hard to sniff out their tail.
However, that girl is needed to figure out the culprit and their reasoning."

"But in that case, isn't it unnecessary to have her enroll in our club?
It should have been enough to just be careful around her..."

"Ayame also said this, right?
It is unclear what that girl will do if we leave her out of sight, so it's safer to take her in.
Then there would be no worries of her doing anything strange.
It would be unbearable if she turned into a vector like a mosquito carrying malaria or a black rat."

"Muu-"

I did explain my reasoning for the time being, but Hatsushiba's expression was still clouded, as if not entirely convinced.

She really didn't intend to forgive her that easily.

Ayame looked like she already reached a decision.
Sometimes the surrounding people get more heated up about things like rumors and injuries, after all.

"...Hey"

Suddenly Hatsushiba let out a quiet voice.

"Hmm?"

"That person was Aramiya-kun's first love, right?"

Don't remind me what I don't want to remember...

"Y-yeah, well... she's the girl that didn't show up after calling me to a faraway park via a love letter..."

"Yeah, I heard that.
Suwama-san sent out that love letter, but she herself was being tricked, right?"

"She is a complete idiot who never even thought about her actions."

She believed in the "that'll make everything go well" spell... to believe that calling one to a faraway park, making him catch a cold, and then not talking with him at all completed an engagement, was clearly ridiculous.

However, that girl had believed in that.

There was no way of describing this person other than an idiot... you could sugarcoat it into "pure" I guess.

"Umm. It isn't like... you can't forget about her, right?"

"What?"

Hatsushiba's words were incomprehensible.
Understanding them took some effort.

"You don't want to reconcile since the misunderstanding was resolved, or something?"

"That's impossible, you know?
Not even in jokes.
I have severed all connections with 3D."

"... Really?"

"You're doubting me too much.
First of all, what do you mean by reconciling?
We didn't have that kind of a relationship during elementary school.
The talks about engagement and so on are her arbitrary delusions."

In actuality it was mutual love, but it was that.
The saying pops up in not just eroge, but also <span title="世間⼀般 = the world in general">RL</span>.

<span title="初恋は実らない">First love doesn't bloom</span>.

I myself didn't have any romantic feelings for Ibu anymore.
First of all, love during elementary school is as fleeting as measles.

"Then it's OK."

Hatsushiba heaved a sigh of relief.

However, she pointed her index finger at me, as if not letting it go yet.

"But, Aramiya-kun must not decrease his time with Cotton."

"How did Ayame pop up in this conversation?"

"In terms of priorities, please follow the order of Cotton, Yuuka, Suwama-san."

"Wait. What priority are you talking about..."

She's probably totally misunderstanding something.

Everyone was trying to fill up my <span title="Refer back to the prologue and the Toyotomi Hideyoshi story">outer moat</span>... do they want to tear down my castle that much?
It seemed like they would invade and fill up the inner moat as well if I was in a daze.

"Still, I don't think it is necessary to have her in our club just for the reasons Aramiya-kun gave."

"You're still saying that..."

"Well, that's because..."

She still had complaints even after explaining so much.
It felt more like she was sulking, but Tozaki would probably say "That expression is also cute!" or something.

"Letting her in was also for a few more things.
To protect our room, and to make sure the before hostile Ayame and Ibu are together, as that would be convenient for purging the rumors..."

As I had mentioned before, it was important to keep her under our watch.

But that wasn't all.

"The culprit might also try to use Ibu again.
It would be the best if we can pin them down at that time."

Hatsushiba just tilted her head quizzically.

Well, the other side would also not move until the excitement died down.
It was fine if they didn't show up during the first semester too.
In that case we needed to wait patiently.

As we returned to the classroom, Ayame and Ibu were chatting like friends for some reason.

"I think this year's popular summer coord is going to be a refreshing one-piece~"

"What is summer coord?"

"Coord is short for coordination! As in, the dress most fit for summer!"

"You seem knowledgeable about those stuff."

"Of course! All girls love fashion. Appearance is important!"

"Depends on the person, right?"

"Apart form that, there's also <span title="サロペット">overalls</span>, <span title="ナチュかわのフリルブラウス">natucute frill blouses</span>, or <span title="ガーリーワンピース">girly one-pieces</span>~"

_TL Note:_ Okay okay wait. What are these terms even. If you are interested in learning more, just google these. I have zero idea about fashion words in Bengali, leave alone Japanese lol.
But well, for your curiosity, here are your [Overalls](https://ryuryumall.jp/onlineprod/1P/1000594/1000594_01_700_700_700_700.jpg), [Natural Cute Blowse (without frills)](https://base-ec2.akamaized.net/images/item/origin/d352f7925810cd312965387982e43b34.jpg), [Girly one-piece](https://base-ec2.akamaized.net/images/item/origin/e33df62b26e3b72fde06aa1d1a67c5d9.jpg).

"... What is that? Some sort of incantation?" _TL Note:_ IFKR?

Well, it looked like Ibu was one-sidedly talking to Ayame.

"Ayame-cchi's hair is suuper pretty, so those types of clothes will definitely fit you~"

"Don't touch me."

"Ouch. No U~"

Ayame slapped Ibu's hands as she was trying to touch her twintails.

"Come on, you won't lose anything by just touching~"

"I don't like being touched by people."

Leaning in and acting all clingy.

Really, Ibu is really friendly with everyone. There are people who like that about her too.

Actually, a lot of things had happened (like the exposure of my past or her suspension), but Ibu's reputation was recovering little by little.
Some of the guys would secretly blush while talking too.

Not to mention though, if the incident about her trying to reverse rape me got leaked, our classmates would probably all be shocked. Although there might be some with strange tastes who would like it.

<span title="蓼⾷う⾍も好き好きというのだ">To each their own</span>.
Everyone has different tastes.
Denying them is the same as denying my own inclinations.

It was needless to say though, I couldn't comprehend them.
<span title="黙して語らず、沈黙は金なり">Keep your mouth shut, silence is money.</span>
The people from old days have spoken wise words.
It was understandable that they would be quoted in eroge.

"Ah, Seiichi, welcome back~"

"Oh, did you finish talking with Yuuka?"

"Yeah, we're done. Rather, aren't you guys pretty friendly already?"

"This girl just keeps talking occasionally."

While making a troubled face, Ayame didn't look like she disliked it that much.

"Ibu has also become pretty attached to Ayame..."

"Yeah, because I like Ayame-cchi!
I'm also jealous since she would become cuter if polished~"

Ayame was a bit troubled at being directed good will, but she didn't seem to completely dislike it.
Otherwise she would have glared daggers at her anyway.

It was also possible that Ibu did a full 180 from disliking Ayame to liking her that much.
It's said that like and dislike are two sides of the same coin, after all.
"The exact opposite of liking is to act indifferent."
A line used in a myriad of eroges, was apparently due to Mother Theresa.

While Ibu and Ayame were getting along with each other, new bad rumors about Ayame would not start spreading.
It was a good thing.

"Hmph!"

Nevertheless, Hatsushiba was still cold towards Ibu.
She also probably had something to say to Ayame, who was (to onlookers) having fun while talking with Ibu.

That being said, she was happy that Ayame was having fun; it was probably complicated.
She probably felt like a mother who was uncomfortable seeing her daughter starting to go out with a delinquent.

Both Ayame and me have gotten over it already; it would be great if Hatsushiba could also do the same.

"A woman's feelings are complicated..."

The Tozaki beside me said with a satisfied expression.
You really aren't one to say though?
Don't try to make a face like a playboy with a lot of experience.

Well, I also agreed on the fact. It was really impossible to understand.

The bell rang as we were talking, signaling the start of the languid afternoon lessons.

&nbsp;

"Well then, that's all from my end. Class Rep, if you please-"

With the sugary voice of Oohara-sensei, the homeroom ended with Class Rep's "stand up - bow".
Today's classes were now over.

The class was wrapped up in hustle and bustle as always. "Where do you wanna go today?", "Let's go to the club!", "I'll be late to cram school if I don't hurry" etc - everyone had different goals.

"Let's also go to our room."

"Yep!" "Ya~"

Hatsushiba and Ibu replied to Ayame.

Then, the three girls glanced at our direction.

"Yeah, yeah. Tozaki is also coming, right?"

"......"

Although I asked him so, Tozaki didn't reply, making a difficult face.

This guy must be holding back from saying something.

"Oi, Tozaki?"

"Ah, Ahh. My bad. Club, right? Let's go."

Well, we could leave it for later. Either way he'll speak up sooner or later.

We left the classroom together, as usual. None of us had cleaning duties today as well.

There was nothing in particular to do, but let's go to the club and spend time in peace.
Maybe I could play some eroge after a long time.
It would help heal my heart from the fuss during lunchtime.

"Ayame-cchi! What should we play today~"

"It's hot, don't stick to me!"

While walking down the hallway, Ayame and Ibu were frolicking around as usual, walking in front of Tozaki and me.
Hatsushiba voiced her complaints from beside us.
It was that type of a scene.

Recently, this had become the norm.

"... Hey Aramiya, you got a moment?"

Tozaki called me as if he wanted to say something, when we left the school building for a moment.

He brought it up unexpectedly early.

"Yeah sure. You have something to talk about?"

Tozaki nodded, and glanced at the girls meaningfully.

I could take a guess.

"... Ah. Could you three go ahead first?"

"'Sup sup, going to the bathroom together~?"

"Whatever, go ahead before us. Also, girls shouldn't say that sort of stuff."

"Hey, Suwama. Let's go already."

"Yea~"

Ayame took Ibu to the wing where the literature club assembled.
Hatsushiba also followed, with a curious expression on her face.

Tozaki and I went over to a place where there were no people around. Tozaki had an awkward expression.

"... So, what's up?
I get the feeling that most of the time it's troublesome when you call me to talk."

"Well, yeah.
It's pretty troublesome.
No, this time I don't have a lot of information... but something curious happened."

Tozaki was scratching his head, as if apologizing for whatever he was about to say being too gloomy.

"Is it that again?"

"Yeah, it's that again. Rumors about Ayame are stirring up again."

"What is it this time?
Something like Ayame is an assassin or an amazoness?"

_TL Note:_ amazon = a big, strong, warrior-like woman, someone who reminds you of the mythical Greek women-warriors, the Amazons. I think in Japanese a woman amazon is made into an "amazoness", but it's not an english word, amazons are women by default.

No, but he did say it's not something too worrysome...

Prompted on by me, Tozaki conflictedly spoke up.

&nbsp;

"Ayame and Ibu are a yuri couple..."

&nbsp;

<span title = "Lily">Yuri</span>.
The perennial flower that resembles a trumpet, gives off a sweet fragrance that can choke you if you sniffed at it.
They come in a variety of colours such as white, yellow, red, or pink.
Personally, I liked white lily the best.

However, for otakus, 『yuri』 was a metaphor for something entirely different.

"By yuri... do they mean girls loving each other?
Like in 『Hitohane』?"

"Yeah, that type.
If you ask me though, I like 『Raspberry Panic』 more."

The anime that gave birth to the phrase "Kimashitawaa". It was also made into a game, if I remember correctly.

_TL Note:_ I think Hitohane is referring to 2015 eroge called [Kimihane: Kanojo to Kanojo no Koi Suru Ikkagetsu](https://vndb.org/v16377), Raspberry panic to [Strawberry Panic](https://vndb.org/v965).

_TL Note:_ Okay now what is "Kimashitawaa"? You can read a pretty descriptive explanation [here](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%EF%BD%B7%EF%BE%8F%EF%BD%BC%EF%BE%80%EF%BE%9C%EF%BD%B0). Basically "Kimashitawaa" was used by [Suzumi Tamao](https://vndb.org/c26899) in only a scene, as a substitute for "Kitaaa"/"KTKR" which means "It's here!"/"It came!" in english. Well, apparently it's now a slang that can be used when you find out that one of your woman friends is in love with another woman (or a trap). Kinda like a substitute for ["Ara^~"](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E3%81%82%E3%82%89%5E%E3%80%9C) (when two girls do kyakya-uwauwa). Research it more on your own if interested. xD

"Why such a rumor again..."

"Probably because the two flirt with each other a lot?"

"But don't other girls also frolic around to a similar degree?"

"That's why I was curious about it."

Only a sigh could come out.

Well, I understood why Tozaki was hesitating to talk about it.

"Has it spread a lot?"

"Well, to some degree...
It started propagating very fast when I noticed."

"SMH. IS that all you had to talk about?"

If it was just about that, he probably didn't have to bother about it that much.

At least it didn't worsen Ayame's reputation.

"It's only that much... but is it really OK?"

"This time should be fine, right?
It'll probably calm down very soon.
Plus, it's not something that portrays Ayame as a scary person."

"Previously there was a rumor about her eating up boys and girls regardless of gender, remember?"

"But, if it's yuri, then it's not that much of a minus point."

"I feel like that only applies to otakus though..."

"... Well, anyhow.
It's a problem between those two; we can't really do anything about it.
We can ignore it since there's no real harm.
I guess we could ban her from being pushed by Ibu's flirting, but that's pretty much it."

We headed towards the clubroom as Tozaki looked like he was convinced for now.
After all, Hatsushiba could become scary if we didn't return as soon as possible.

Still, what club are we again?
Well, there was no mistake in saying that it was a gathering to exterminate rumors about Ayame though...

We headed towards the clubroom after finishing our discussion.

"C-Can I have a moment?"

Just as we were about to enter the clubroom, an unfamiliar boy spoke to us.

Somewhat gloomy, it felt like he was more like one of us, than not.
However, he wasn't an otaku; he didn't give off such a vibe.

Tozaki was shaking his head.
If they weren't acquaintances, just who was this guy?

"... Me?"

"Yeah, I have something to ask you..."

He was making an embarrassed face.

It seemed like he was about to confess or something. No no no, stop it please...

After a few seconds, he spoke up as if he had straightened his resolve.
With an expression resembling that of a samurai about to challenge a once-in-a-lifetime battle,

&nbsp;

"Is it true that Ayame and Suwama are gay for each other?"

&nbsp;

It was an astonishingly idiotic question.

It was sad that there were people who believed in the rumor we were talking about earlier.

"Nope, not at all. Where the heck did you hear that from?"

"N-no, people were talking about it, so..."

"What people?"

"P-people as in, my classmates and such..."

Apparently he's from our neighboring class.
Probably they had seen the two during the joint PE classes.
If they were frolicking around during the girls' PE classes, then it may have permeated from them to the boys...

"It's totally a groundless rumor. Anyway, what's wrong if they were gay for each other?"

"Umm, n-no, it's nothing. Sorry about that!"

The guy sped away.

"Just what was that about?"

Tozaki shrugged.

"Aramiya. I can only get a bad premonition out of this."

"Your premonition might come true, so don't raise the flag..."

&nbsp;
