Around two weeks after the happenings from last time,

"It's the closing ceremony~! Summer vacations start tomorrow!"

"Su-Suwama-sa~n.
Homeroom is still not over, so don't make frolic already~"

Ibu's jovial shout troubled our homeroom teacher Oohara-sensei.

WEll, the semester exams have ended, and like Ibu said, the summer vacation starts tomorrow.
We also got back our report cards, so no wonder she's in high spirits.

Not just Ibu, everyone in the class seemed to be trying their best not to run wild.

"Well then, everyone,
Without forgetting that you're students, please enjoy the once-in a lifetime summer vacation of your second year of high school to your fullest.
Make sure not to get into trouble."

Everyone gave a half-hearted response, and that ended the homeroom.

"That was dangerous... If I got that problem wrong, I'd have failed in math..."

Ayame's face was still pale; apparently she was yet to recover from the exam spell.

Somehow no one failed a single subject.
Everyone avoided the make-up lessons.

There are some days when we have to show up, but not until mid-August.

"You can be relieved already.
But, we still have homework, so don't set all loose."

"...Yeah, we sure got a lot of that."

Ayame drops her shoulders.

What a busybody.

"How will you do your homework, Aramiya?
Little by little e veryday?"

"I'll finish it in two days."

"...For real?"

"I must finish it all before the software I was talking about earlier gets on sale so that I won't have anything to worry about.
I'll definitely finish the homework first.
In order to complete the software!"

"Maybe I should do the same..."

While talking about such stuff, the usual members head towards the classroom.

As we get out of the classroom and head towards the club building,

"Kotoko-saaan!"

Kiyomi showed up,

"I-I've been in your care, senpai..."

And the library committee member Saitani peeked from behind.

Today, on the final club activity of the semester, we had decided on discussing a certain topic in the clubroom.
And Saitani also has a huge role in that discussion.

"Well, let's discuss stuff in the clubroom.
Since we all have things to say and things to ask."

"I don't really have a lot to say, yes!"

Cute.

His habit of joining his hands in front of his chest is super destructive.
He must be aiming for your heart.

"Still, it's so peaceful...
I wonder how things reached such a calm ending."

If I think back, I could have even gotten expelled in the worst case earlier.

Well, maybe expulsion was taking it too far, but suspension was definitely possible.

My rumor also faded away at the speed of light after that day's happenings.

While being overcome with strong feelings, we notice three silhouttes standing in front of the club building's entrance."

"How do you do."

It was the student council president and her two minions.

Every one of us switched to alert mode.
Except for Saitani and Kiyomi, the air around everyone else strained.

"Is anything the matter?"

Ayame takes the first hit and asks.
The pressure rising up in her pupils were not to be trifled.
It's fine if you don't glare at them that hard.

"No,..."

The president's gaze shifted from Ayame to me.

"I've something to talk about."

"...Okay, okay."

Ayame's face stiffened in anxiety.

"It's fine.
It's not like she'll try anything funny after all this time.
Take the keys and go ahead to the clubroom.
Our talk will end pretty fast anyway."

"Yeah, let me promise.
I'll keep these two stationed over here."

Transferring the key over to Ayame, I walk a bit away from the club building with the president.

In the desolate backside of the building, we face each other. 

Then, the president opens up her folding fan and points it towards me.

"I've not given up on Ayame yet.
Her beauty is unparalleled.
That's all I wanted to say."

"That again?
Well, do as you like."

"Of course, I'll respect her own will.
But, for the next eight months, I'll go on the offensive until I graduate."

"Like I said, do as you please."

"...Goodness.
You're worthless as a rival."

"I have no intention to fight over her, so..."

It's bothersome, after all.

Heaving a deep sigh, the president hands over something.

"Accept this."

It was an envelope.
Its contents were - probably money.

"Because she caused you problems.
It's for your Y-shirt and T-shirt."

"Is it the student council's money?"

"No, it's my pocket money.
I'll never use the student council funds for my personal matters."

...This person's pocket money?

Well, let's accept it for now.

There's no reason to associate deeply, and it's questionable to have her indebted for my uniform.
Plus, having my parents pay for it is also ridiculous.

"Well, the student council budget will be used to protect your club.
Let's try to accommodate your club's budget.
As that's directly related to preserving Ayame-san's otherworldly beauty."

"Are you serious?"

"I am.
I pushed the topic into the student council's plans."

"...Isn't that extraordinary as an apology for causing inconvenience?"

"Yes. That's why I have a condition."

"What is it?"

What kind of a condition will you put up now?

&nbsp;

"...Let me play 18+ games in your clubroom as well."

&nbsp;

What's she talking about... Wait, what?

"Are you crazy?"

"I'm perfectly sane!
I have to play them while not having any safe haven, you know!?
I want a space where I can feel completely unconstrained!
That's a similarity amongst us.
It was a space that I had my eyes set on, but while I was occupied with other things..."

"President was also starving, I see."

"Shut it!
My lifestyle is completely restrained at home and at school, so it can't be helped, right!
I need a place where I can show all the lust on my face!"

Hmmph!
She averts her eyes with folded arms.

Her face was bright red.
It might be the first time that she showed an adorable expression.

"And with that, we won't owe each other anything."

"Well, you do have my thanks, president.
That I got cleared of suspicion from the teachers and my rumor dying out was both the president's doing, right?"

After that incident, the talks about clubroom inspection also died out along with my rumors.
It was as if everyone lost interest with a snap of someone's fingers.

President telling the principal that it wasn't required was a huge help.
She doesn't have authority, but she is highly trusted.

"You understood that well."

"There was no other possibility."

"Well, I also was involved in the rumors.
I made up the yuri rumor, after all."

As expected.

"Well, I didn't think it would affect the reputation of your personality."

Eh?

"What did you just say?"

"I didn't expect people would start bending that rumor to degrade your personality."

"...Wait a second."

Something is off.

"It wasn't you who spread that second rumor about my debauchery or whatever?"

"Of course I wouldn't.
What merit do I have in doing that anyway?
I did spread a rumor about Ayame-san and others being yuri, but I didn't even touch your topic.
That your rumor got faded was just a side product of deleting the yuri rumor."

"Wait... then who spread the rumor about me?"

"Who knows?
I haven't figured out that much.
But well, I felt some evil directed at you while investigating... so tread carefully, so that you don't make Ayame-san feel sad."

With that, the president takes her leave.
