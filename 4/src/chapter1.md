# Chapter 1: Isn’t there too much homework?

### Part 1

> TL: ArkTL

There’s a pile of books on the desk.

Japanese, Maths, Modern Society e.t.c. , textbooks and notes, shining because of the morning light yet in this irregular atmosphere.

Those are all the summer homework we have to do.

“…, Looking at this, isn’t there too much homework.”

Japanese is to write kanji and do a reading reflection and some questions.

Math you have to do two full books of exercises, with 15 pages each.

English, you have one book with 20 pages.

Chemistry is a question book,

Physics is also a question book.

Modern Society you have to write an essay about either politics or war.

History you have a question book.

The elective Music is that you have to perform the specified song once the semester starts.

ICT( Information and communications technology), is to write an essay about patents or something about IT.

World History is just a book report.

“My school work before is 1.5 times of yours though.”

Kiriko-nee who stayed here last night, whilst grabbing one of the question books muttered.

“Why did you come in my room.”

“It’s because I saw you looking at your desk with no energy, it makes me want to say what are you doing~”

*Sigh*, Kiriko-nee will barge in without knocking anyways so it’s not that it matters.

“1.5 times huh… Kiriko-nee’s school is a through-train?” (TN note: In case you don't know what is through-train , its like you can study at the same school as your middle school in high school; in ASIA)

“It’s not though. And some of my college peeps have 3 times the amount of yours.”

3 times… I can’t believe such a scary school exists.

Don’t tell me, our school already has little homework!

Whilst looking at the mountain of homework, I opened the English exercise book.

“Ohiro-sensei looks so kind normally, who would have though his homework was this thick… And the words, so small and scrambled…”

My eyes hurt. If it’s like this I wouldn’t mind more pages but… I just hoped the words could be larger.

“Probably it’s because he is gentle he put so much work up. He hopes you to learn much after all. And when you’re in a foreign country, if you can use English fluently, you could get a job easily.”

“So it’s like that… I guess you could have this mindset.”

Like if you learn the basics of English when you’re in high school.

In the future, when eroges become a worldwide thing, you can live off this industry, or at least become one of the options.

Also apparently if you learn English, it would also be easier to learn other languages.

…No, if you think carefully. Outside, especially America, don’t they have a high restriction on 18 plus games? It seems like a hard thing to import them to North America.

High school students like us, just one little mistake and it’s going to be labeled as child p*rn.

“An English job eh…”

“It also benefits you when you’re traveling, after all English is used in many countries.”

“Putting this aside Kiriko-nee.”

“What?”

“You smell of wine…”

It’s not a rare thing for Kiriko-nee to be at home, she comes here to eat all the time. But yesterday she just drank with mum and dad like crazy. They waited until we were asleep and quietly drank until sunrise.

But they still can go on a trip huh, just how strong are they…

“Don’t give me this bullsh*t. I’m on holiday, just still have work that is.”

Even when Kiriko-nee ate Ayame’s special breakfast, she still looks soulless.

Then she wrapped her arms around my neck, I guess she’s still drunk.

“Say, how much did you drink.”

“Beer, sake, shochu, liquor… So much. I can’t even remember.”

“For real, this is hindering the education of young people.”

Wine, this stuff even if you smell it nearby. You already know ‘Ah, I can’t drink this’.

If we wait until the legal age, will our minds change?

Although you say this, but our house is basically full of secret stashes of wine.

“You… Come on, make it quicker so you can drink wine. Even though you broke the rules of 18+ games, but you say you can’t break the rule of drinking.”

“A teacher is encouraging a minor to drink…”

“I did not encourage you, are your ears donkey ears.”

“Don’t understand, are you still drunk?”

“I won’t be drunk only on this level, but to say my head hurts a little.”

“You’re just not awake, you’re annoying so get your ass off to the living room.”

I shoved off Kiriko-nee’s arms.

“Wah~ So cold. La~Lazy… I want to drink water.”

After Kiriko-nee went out, I once again looked on the desk.

The astonishing amount of workbooks and worksheets, it’s just like mount Himalayas.

I need to finish this pile of homework within three days… If I can two days will be of the best.

It’s already summer holiday, yet to speak it’s almost the end if the holiday.

It’s the last day of this summer holiday… not.

It’s the first day of the holiday and it’s 9 in the morning, I only woke up a bit late compared to usual.

And from this morning the sunshine was so bright that the room feels like a desert, let’s just turn on the A.C. to lower the temperature.

This is also something to soothe my feelings for this pile of work.

If I plan to do my homework a little day by day, it wouldn’t take up so much time.

You just have to replace the time of lazing around to finish your work and that’s it.

But, I have a reason on why I must finish my homework early.

When I tightened my resolve in front of my work, I can hear the phone ringing.

“Tozaki?”

My smartphone showed the name of my fellow eroge enthusiast: ‘Keita Tozaki’.

“Yo. What's up? Calling me this early.”

[Eh, you’re already starting your homework already?]

“I’m just starting now. The temperature didn’t go down yet.”

[Say, isn’t there too much work?]

“I feel you.”

[Then, let’s negotiate.]

Now, as if we’re discussing something bad, Tozaki changed into a tone as if he’s bribing a guard.

[Wanna divide our work, like last year?]

I cut the call…

On paper, it of course sounds like a good deal, I also think so myself but… Even I have that student pride… not…

Well…

“I modeled the plan yesterday, so let’s get this sh*t done asap.”

If it’s for “Destiny Rider: Zero”, I can easily do this!

And yes… My reason to complete the pile of homework is of course, the new eroge…

### Part 2
> TL: Potla

Honestly speaking, book reports often turn into just a plain summary.
While such a form is efficient for earning good grades, the disadvantage is that you have to read the entire work to be able to write a good summary.

Frankly, I don't have time for that, and neither do I need to.
I'd prefer writing my impressions about the work, meaning that there's a lot of freedom in the choice of the writing style.
There's no rule saying that one needs to read the entire book to write a report on it.

You can read the prologue, imagine how the story proceeds after that, and submit a writeup on it.
Even that works as a proper book report.

> _Potla:_ Does it, though? lol

For example, say a story starts with _"The scenery of a snow country unfolded as soon as we got out of the tunnel..."_.
But I've personally never visited a snow country.
How does it even feel to walk on snow?
Is it similar to walking on top of sand?
If I get the chance, I'd definitely want to visit such a country.
However, I'm a little bad with the cold, so I must research on warm clothes resistant to the cold and snow.

My book reports are always like this.
But even that is a viable "report" on a "book".
While the teachers might not like it and frown upon it.

> _Potla_: The Japanese for "book report" is literally 読書感想⽂, which means "reading impression text". So Seiichi is basically playing around with the meaning of the kanji.

"Aight, that ends the Japanese language book report assignment.
This is a good pace.
I've already completed all the workbooks and printouts, so what's remaining is the History book report, and that IT-related essay.
There's also that assignment for playing the score for the [recorder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sso4vjERgdA).
But if I do it now, I'll probably forget by the time the terms starts.
It's better to do it the day before the music class after the term starts..."

Tomorrow is the day 『Destiny: Zero』 gets released.

> _Potla_: Clearly a parody of Fate: Zero, if you're still wondering.

Pulling an almost all-nighter to work on the homework was definitely a worthwhile endeavor.

"It's good that I don't have to be sleepless when I line up to buy the game at dawn tomorrow."

> _Potla_: wtf, that's some real dedication.

I'm sleepy right now, but will probably be able to sleep at 8 pm or something tonight.

In other words, I can engross myself in playing with my best physical condition.

I'm unstoppable now. Hahaha, I feel like I rule the universe right now!

As I was feeling high from sleeplessness while taking a short break, my phone snapped me out of the euphoria by shouting its ringtone.

"Who dares bring me out of my own world... wait, it's Ayame."

The name on the screen was my classmate, Ayame Kotoko.

As soon as I tap on the receive button--.

"Aramiya! Please save me!"

Her desperate scream traversed from my right ear all the way to my left.

I had reflexively pulled the phone away from my ear as the volume was loud enough to tear my membrane.

But listening to her urgent plea, I put the phone back on my ear.

"What happened!? Are you in danger?"

"Literally, so.
I'm blocked from all sides, and have no route of escape!"

"Calm down.
Did you get into some sort of trouble again?
In that case, you should first get in touch with the police---"

"Ah, no. It's nothing of that sort."

"Do not hit whoever is cornering you.
That'll lead to a disadvantage......
Wait, what do you mean by nothing of that sort?"

"Y-yeah.
I'm not in an accident or assault or anything."

Is that so.
I had assumed she got herself wrapped up into some such accident again.

"If you're not in trouble, don't call with such an urgent tone!"

"It is an extreme urgency though!"

"Meh, I get it.
What happened?
Anyway for now, take some deep breaths and talk about what's up."

"*Exhale*〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜…… *Inhale*〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜〜……"

Ayame started taking deep breaths.
It was interesting that she was honestly doing it thorough and thorough.

Immediately after, she asks me for consultation.

"Umm, you see.
The homework doesn't seem like it's gonna end."

"Huh?"

"I-I tried my best on my own!
I've solved whatever I could solve by myself!
B-but, there are so many problems that I don't get how to solve.
I don't think I can finish everything by today... or even tomorow..."

"...You don't really have to keep me company though.
I'm only working hard to finish the homework so that I can play 『Destiny: Zero』 without anything holding me back.
Pretty sure you'll get enough time to finish the homework after finishing the game, anyway."

"Y-you're right about that, but!
I have many events during summer too...
I also want to complete the homework right now, and then play 『Destiny: Zero』.
Together with you..."

"As for me, I don't mind showing you the answers on the last day of vacation though."

"For real!?
You're a life-saver... wait, no no!!
If I do that I'll definitely lag behind studies in the second term.
There's no point in that.
I want to do the homework using my own effort as much as I can.
B-but, you see... I alone can't do it..."

In other words, she wants me to teach her.

Well, if she can get better at studies during the second term, it'll definitely help combat the bad rumors about her that were going rampant.

Plus, she's this motivated right now. She'll definitely lose interest in studies if I drop water on her at this timing.

I do have leeway, so not like I have to hesitate in teaching her.

"Got it.
You can come over to my place."

"I-is it fine?"

"Wasn't that what you wanted to do from the beginning?
No need to act so reserved."

"Thanks! I'll go over right now!"

And then she cut the call in a hurry.

"Well then, guess I'll prepare some barley tea..."

> _Potla_: What's there to prepare for serving barley tea lol.

At that moment, my phone started ringing again.

"Who's it this time? Ayame again?"
