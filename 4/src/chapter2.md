# Chapter 2: Is she your girlfriend?

> Disqus Volume 4 [here](https://https://potla1995.github.io/Chuuko-demo-Koi-ga-Shitai/4/index.html).

...I'm sleepy.

I slept at 4am after Ayame and the others left, but had to wake up at 9.

"Sleeping for five hours should be just enough, but... she's still not here."

It's already 30 minutes before the store opens -- that is, 10:30 in the morning.
However, Ayame is nowhere to be seen.

I'm currently standing outside the building that has the game shop.
There's already a huge line.
The few staff were trying to manage the line while shouting instructions.
The general public were stealing glances at the scene as if wondering what was happening, but they didn't seem to have much of an interest in it.

Under the clear sky, the line was gradually growing in front of me.
There was no fancy roof to block the sunlight, so the direct sun was shining and the people in line were drenched in sweat.
I heard that today would be the hottest day of the year.

But I can't get in line yet.
It's also not legal to get in line now and try to get Ayame in when she arrives.
Even if you are temporarily away from the line, there are rules and manners that apply to queuing up.
It is the same at Comiket.
If someone breaks the line, they should die.

I could just ignore Ayame and get in the line, but...
There would be no point in coming to buy the game together.
I'll only get to see her disgruntled face again if I do that.

"Although I'll be able to buy it for sure because of my advance reservation..."

But, you start to lose patience if there's a delay in getting it in hand like this.

"It's hot..."

As I waited, groggy from the heat, I saw a girl running from the end of the line.

"S-sorry! I'm late!"

Ayame finally arrives.
From her breathing, you can see that she has been running at full speed, but being late is being late.

"You're late.
We won't make it in time for the opening of the sales."

"I-I'm sorry! Really!"

"Well, it's fine.
Let's quickly get in lineー"

As soon as I turned around to get in line with her, I felt a chill run down my spine.

"Aramiya?"

Ayame tilted her head at me.

She is oblivious to the danger that is closing in on us.

We must take action as soon as possible...!

"...Ayame. We'll naturally move away from this line.
Right now!"

"Eh, why?
Didn't we come here to get in the line?"

"Just follow me!"

There was no time to explain.

Getting off the side of the line, we passed by the people acting like "we came from the other side of the line, and didn't meant to cut into it."

The people in line look at me quizzically, but I don't care.
Everyone here is a genuine otaku.
In fact, we should be all like-minded.

Ahh, 『Destiny Zero』　is getting farther and farther away...

"W-what's wrong, Aramiya?
Are you angry at me?"

"It's not that."

I just wanted to avoid the dangerous situation that could have happened.

"Just give them the feeling that you're here to have fun in front of the station.
Otherwise, it's not good."

"O-okay. If Aramiya says so."
